# Welcome to the <workshopName> Workshop!

Thanks for taking the time to attend this workshop @<username>. My name is @<botName> and my job is to get you an environment to work in.

I'm already creating your environment, I'll send you a message with the details when its up.

Until then, you can say `help` to find out what else I can do for you!
